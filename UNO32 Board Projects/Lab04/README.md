Lab 4 README

In this lab, we were tasked with processing user input in the form of 
reverse polish notation for our calculator program. We had to create safety harnesses 
to check for valid forms of input and return the appropriate error messages if the input 
was incorrect. The input provided by the user was meant to be stored within a stack for 
later recollection and modification. We had to create functions that modified the stack by 
adding values or popping them back out when necessary for calculations. The most important aspect
of this lab was probably the creation of test harnesses which checked the accuracy of our calculator
program. Without these test harnesses, we would have no way of knowing whether our program actually 
functions properly or not.

My general approach was to start with rpn.c and more specifically the function RPN_Evaluate, but I could
not get it to process the invalid token error correctly. I also could not figure out how to declare a stack properly and 
push values onto it. The toughest part for me was trying to figure out how to convert user input from its reverse polish
notation form to something that could be easily worked with in my calculator section. I also have been dealing with a 
severe illness lately that has caused me a tremendous amount of stress. 

My lab unfortunately does not function properly... I spent well over 10 hours trying to figure it out.
I have a strong dislike for stack manipulation after dealing with it in CSE12. I also dislike the concept 
of reverse polish notation because it seems so unnecessary and confusing to interpret. The hardest part 
to me was trying to figure out how to convert this input in RPN into something that my calculator function 
could comprehend.
