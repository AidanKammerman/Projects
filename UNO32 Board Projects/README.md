Computer Systems and C Programming

#Throughout the Computer Systems and C Programming course,
I've embarked on a journey to master C programming within the realm of embedded systems development. 
Beginning with foundational concepts, I've delved into the intricacies of C syntax and basic operations, 
gradually building my understanding of control flow, modular coding practices, and memory management. 
Working primarily with the MicroChip PIC32 platform, I've honed my coding skills through hands-on experimentation and problem-solving. 
Each lab, from the introductory stages to more advanced topics, has been a stepping stone in my journey, requiring dedicated time and effort 
outside of class to refine my code and grasp the nuances of embedded programming. Overall, the course has provided me with invaluable insights and skills 
that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors in the field of computer systems and embedded programming.
