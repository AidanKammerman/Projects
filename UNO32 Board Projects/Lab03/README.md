In this lab, we were tasked with coding common matrix operations through 
the implementation of many different functions. We were then tasked with 
creating various test cases to determine the accuracy of each function we created.
This second step was the more important aspect of the lab because creating 
proper test harnesses for one's code solutions is a huge part of the debugging process. 

My approach to this lab consisted of starting with the most basic functions after MatrixPrint()
I tested each function as I went because I knew that some of them would have to be functioning
properly in order to be implemented into the next function. What I am trying to say is that some 
functions relied on the correctness of the ones preceeding them which is why I decided to test them 
one by one. It's also a good programming habit in general to test as you go.
The biggest thing that went wrong was my attempt at implementing for loops in my MatrixSubmatrix()
function. I was stumped on this method for over an hour, and eventually I decided to just create the 
whole thing out of many else-if statements. My matrixPrint() function worked well within the first few tries
so I would approach that the same way. I just wish I could have figured out how to get my 
MatrixDeterminant() function to work because I was stumped on it for a long time as well. 

I ended up spending around 10 hours on this lab as well. I dislike how much more difficult it is to get the ball 
rolling at first compared to in-person lab settings where the instructions can be reviewed in much more detail.
I liked thinking my way through each of the various functions as each one felt like a mini puzzle that I had to complete.
Overall this was a worthwhile lab but I think I would've got more out of it if it was in a normal in-person setting.
The point distribution seems fair, and I really appreciate the one point cushion you have added as well :)
I think more teaching on the concepts in this lab such as MatrixDeterminant() and MatrixInverse() would be very 
beneficial too.
