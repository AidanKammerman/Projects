Conclusion:

What did you do in this lab? 

	In this lab, we were tasked with getting comfortable with the 
basic layout and functionality of the MP LAB X IDE through various implementations of code.
We had to transfer segments of code onto the uno32 hardware and successfully run them.
We also had to debug a sorting algorithm and record its process along the way.
We also had to create a program that converted different temperature values and formatted them in a way
that was visually pleasing. Finally, we had to display a message on the Uno32 hardware
OLED, that message being "Hello World!".

What mistakes did you make, and how did you identify and solve them?

	A few mistakes that I made included failing to include certain header files in my main program file. This caused 
the system to run into errors which I easily realized how to resolve. I also couldn't figure out how to connect 
my uno32 hardware for a long time because I did not adjust the baudrate. Finally, I did not realize at first 
that I had to transfer my main files into the source code section of the IDE in order for them to be integrated properly.

Do you have any feedback for us about this lab?

	The only thing I would suggest for you to fix about the lab document is including the step about changing
the baudrate on the uno32 hardware using the coolterm software because I am sure that caused people a fair bit of confusion.
