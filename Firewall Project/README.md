Here is a firewall project that I worked on in python to be utilized with my topology that I also wrote in python designated for Mininet. By implementing this firewall with my topology in mininet, it simulates the application of a practical firewall. I have analyzed how packets traverse through the topology and how they are affected by the rules dictated by my firewall using Wireshark.
